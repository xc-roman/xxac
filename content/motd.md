Welcome to DroneOps Terminal 18.04 LTS! This terminal is your view into the heart of Xxac Industries. From here, you can
review basic employee records, flagged surveillance recordings, and drone log entries.

## What's new in 18.04

* Drone log entries are now formatted in a way that non-drones will be able to understand
* CCTV captures are now linked to employee details

Please be patient as data is migrated.

## Security warning

It has been noticed by management that some employees have not been locking their terminals while away from their
workstations. Please be sure that your workspace is secure before leaving it unsupervised.

The DroneOps terminal hosts highly sensitive and privileged information, it is important that we all play our part to
keep it secure.
