# Xxac Industries site

This repo hosts the source for the Xxac Industries lore, a collection of erotic stories and art depicting rubber,
leather, transformation, and other kinks inside a fictional futuristic universe.

## Mechanisms

The project is separated into multiple areas, each expressing content in different ways.

### Log entries

A log entry is like a blog post, but in the context of one or more employees. These are the written stories of the
project. Log entries are written in the voice of the primary employee (the first in the list of employees).

### CCTV captures

These are images, usually attached to a log entry. A CCTV capture might try to look like it was actually a screenshot
from a surveillance camera, such as by including common UI elements of such a system.

### Employee listings

An employee listing is like a character profile, gathering recent log entries and displaying a gallery of all CCTV
captures. You might use this to publish your character references.

Note that the gallery in an employee listing consists of all images in the `assets/img/drones/gallery/<id>` folder, not
necessarily those images which are contained in a log entry. Make sure that all images are ready for publishing when you
commit them.

## Contributing

I welcome and greatly encourage contributions of stories and other artworks to this universe. Please fork and then
create a pull request to this repository. There are no particular content rules, other than "it needs to fit in the
universe". I consider the project to work similarly to the SCP project.

There is no requirement for writing stories or creating artwork either, you may wish to just host your character
references here. This is totally okay, and just as welcome as any other requests.

### Content guidelines

* As the nature of the project, content should be primarily homosexual and male focused
* Effort should be made to conform to existing art and writing styles
* Contributions should be made in good faith

#### Objectionable material

While most kinks and sexual fantasies are permitted here, there is some content that is absolutely not permitted. This
includes but is not limited to the violation of minors, even fictional or ambiguous. If you believe your content would
not be accepted in the wider kink community, then it will certainly not be permitted here.

#### Licensing

When contributing work to the project, you must allow me a non-exclusive license to be able to host it. This means you
must own the content, or otherwise have permission to contribute it here. This will be detailed further when you make a
pull request.

Note that the licenses you give me may be revoked by you or the owner, that's okay. Simply create a pull request to
remove the content.
